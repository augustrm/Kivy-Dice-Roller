# kivy dice roller
Kivy UI Python application for rolling dice, primarily for Warhammer 40,000
## Note: Kivy's default wheel available through PyPi is not compatible with Python 3.8+!
This can be remidied by installing a newer release of Kivy via pip with the command:

```
pip install kivy==2.0.0rc2
```
Please note that as Kivy's developement progresses, the above version may not be suitable and you will need to change the "==2.0.0rc2" part to accomodate updates to Kivy.

Due to Kivy's somewhat tempermental nature concerning python versions, I plan to rewrite this in Qt5. This makes packaging the application up in a neat binary a bit easier as well
