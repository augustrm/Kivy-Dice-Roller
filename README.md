# kivy_dice_roller
Kivy Python application for rolling dice
## Note: Kivy's default wheel available through PyPi is not compatible with Python 3.8+!
This can be remidied by installing a newer release of Kivy via pip with the command:

```
pip install kivy==2.0.0rc2
```
Please note that as Kivy's developement progresses, the above version may not be suitable and you will need to change the "==2.0.0rc2" part to accomodate updates to Kivy
